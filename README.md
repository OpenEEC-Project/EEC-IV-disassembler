# EEC-IV-disassembler
semi automatic disassembler for Ford EEC-IV and V binaries

I have posted my development source files here.
They should compile with pretty much any of the standard C or c++ compilers out there
I have compiled this with both Code:Blocks and Codelite IDE tools.
This code should work on both Linux and Windows as a CONSOLE project.
This code has no graphical interface and is a straight command line console app.

I admit some of the code is a bit messy and I use lots of pointers ...

This code is DEVELOPMENT so it has commented out code, probably unused subroutines still left in, and may have
features which are not fully robust.  It probably still has bugs to be found.
It also has a lot of extra debuggung messages written to the xx_msgs.txt file than a production release, and possibly
even some temporary cryptic ones (like "ZZ")  which are embedded to make an easy breakpoint !

Fixed 3 bugs in data struct printout.
Fixed bug in parse_command which can cause crash.
