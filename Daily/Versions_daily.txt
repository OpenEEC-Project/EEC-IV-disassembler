4.0.7.1  (22 June 2020)

Complete rework of internal bank structure layout.

1. Fixed display of RAM addresses in multibanks to always show bank.
2. Fixed bank location error with 'short bank' file layouts (e.g. RZAS range)
3. Improved bank location to handle more .bin file layout problems automatically.
3. Added support for later "StepD" 8065 with extra address mode.
4. Widened allowed address range in each bank to support specialist chips.
4. Reworked pseudo code for contional jumps for Carry (JC/JNC),  Overflow (JV/JNV)
  

NB. overflow is still probably wrong for some cases - awaiting more feedback.


4.0.6 released as stable (was 4.0.6P)
